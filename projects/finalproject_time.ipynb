    "There is a wide variety of mathematical models for time-evolving systems formulated as sets of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Examples range from meteorology and population dynamics to celestial mechanics and chemical reactions. In many cases, these ODEs cannot be solved analytically, and instead they are simulated by means of numerical time integration. In this assignment we will explore various various time integration methods.\n",

Compare your numerical solution with the exact solution: make a plot of $x(t)$ versus $t$ for both solutions, and plot $H$ versus $t$. Pick a set of initial conditions (e.g. the corners of a square, $(x_0, y_0) = (1\\pm 0.5, \\pm 0.5)$), integrate these forward up to $t=10$, and plot the paths $(x(t),y(t))$. Compare with the exact solution.\n",
